This is a student-project for a group of students at Oulu University of Applied Sciences, for a Bachelor of Engineering programme in Information and Communications Technology. This mobile development project lasted approximately 2 months during Spring 2023.

# Project Stack

## Front-end

The front-end interface is made with Flutter. As the project was a mobile development project, the project was designed with mobile devices in mind.

## Back-end

The back-end of the application is done using the free tier of Firebase. Using Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database to authenticate logins and store and serve data for the end user.


# Tools used

For coding, some of the team members used Visual Studio Code, some used IntelliJ. We did not stick to a single IDE, as we decided that everyone can use whatever setup they wish as long as it works.

Project management such as handling tasks etc. was done with Trello.

Project meeting documents, design documents, etc. were hosted in a team inside Microsoft Teams.


# Who did what?

The graphical design was done by @Raitokomniak.
Back-end (Setting up firebase, and linking it to the app, and the functions related to the backend) was handled by @Tinosaurus and @pahvone and @Shambambulish.
@t1rima00, @Shambambulish and @Raitokomniak were in charge of designing page layouts and the functionality therein.
